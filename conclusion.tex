\section{Concluding Remarks}

We introduce and investigate a generalized Byzantine model inspired by component and dynamic failures. We first considered the interactive
consistency problem in this model, for which we gave 
necessary and sufficient conditions with
oral and signed messages. We also provided an upper bound for reaching binary consensus. 
Studying other problems in this model or applying it to the eventually synchronous 
context are interesting research directions. 

%Future work could focus on the consensus problem, partial synchrony or even asynchrony.
%Another possible thing one could do is to apply the methods in this paper to
%other models, especially for link failure models.
